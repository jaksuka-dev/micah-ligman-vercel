					<p align="justify">Bustling your dress makes it easier for you to mingle and dance without tripping or stepping on your train. If the dress has a lot of beadwork put a sheet over the dressform before putting the dress on it to protect the beadwork. Normally i like to make the bustle that is in the middle a little higher than the outer two but it didn t work in this case. <br>
