					<p align="justify">The first step in creating your own wedding dress is to think of what the dress should look like. Since most wedding gowns are white and either have some sort of satin material or a lace overlay the material from your dress will make the perfect candidate for a lingerie set. Be careful to keep fabric swaths as large as possible until it comes time to cut the pattern. <br>
