							<h1>Do You Tip Seamstress Wedding Dress</h1>

	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">Do you tip the seamstress who altered your wedding dress. Believe me i do appreciate tips but it is never expected. If you purchased your gown at a bridal salon you can most likely get dress alterations done there it s possible the salon might not offer alterations though in which case you should head to a seamstress or tailor who specializes in bridal gowns. <br>
