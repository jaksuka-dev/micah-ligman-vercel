																	<strong>Average cost of dry cleaning a wedding dress</strong>. 
								
																	Before getting the answer to how much does it cost to dry clean a wedding dress you should know many gown cleaning experts will use a wet cleaning method. 
																	With nearly 200 years experience and a specialist team of experts we offer an unrivalled professional wedding dress cleaning and preservation service. 
																	It is my understanding that dry cleaning chemicals are reused and this could cause a white dress to come out a bit dingy after cleaning. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Unless the dry cleaner processes more than 100 wedding gowns a year consider going to a nearby professional gown preservationist with a noted track record instead. 
																	When the wedding day is over you just take it off and it s most probably never wear it again. 
																	Or perhaps the lights in the bridal shop are brighter and gave you the illusion that the dress was actually whiter when in fact it may not have been so white. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	For this american couples spend an average of 200 to more than 500 in order to dry clean a wedding dress. 
																	Try a local dry cleaning firm as thye may be more reasonable. 
																	At johnsons cleaners we know that every single wedding gown is precious. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	With dry cleaning the process begins with the pre treatment of stains and dirt using a specific cleaning agent. 
																	Another option is to try the high street cleaners when i asked about mine i was told that my local branch get a lot of ball gowns in for cleaning as there is a local barracks and you d be suprised how many of those dresses are ivory and quite detailed as ball gown cleaning is half the price of wedding dresses. 
																	Wedding gown dry cleaning should never cost you more than 200. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	By the middle of 2018 the average cost of a wedding gown is roughly 1 300. 
																	Though many dry cleaners claim to clean wedding gowns most are not specialists. 
																	The cleaning and preservation package costs 285 while the wedding dress cleaning only package. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Most dry cleaning services offer flat rate prices for your entire dress but some places will charge you extra if they find.
