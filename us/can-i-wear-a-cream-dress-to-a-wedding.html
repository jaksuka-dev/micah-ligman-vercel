																	As for the border lines colors cream lig. 
																	Now im wearing a cream audry hepburn type dress with black spots on it to a wedding. 
																	Its not lace or any kind od material that would be worn as a wedding dress so i m just curious.

													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	As bridal wear is evolving so is what guests are wearing lein founder and designer meredith stoecklein tells tzr. 
																	I have bought a dress which is patterned and not cream black. 
																	The dress i would like to wear to my brother s wedding is a cream coloured dress with short sleeves it falls just below my knees.

																	It s definitely possible that dress codes have relaxed but i still think it s widely considered a faux pas to wear white or cream. 
																	Went to a wedding where a guest wore a cream prom dress. 
																	I m very confident that almost everyone knows not to wear white white.

													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	And even though everyone tells me i can every time i think of wearing it i feel really bad and uncomfortable i have another dress i can wear incase but should i wear. 
																	Yes you can wear pants to a wedding if dresses aren t your thing. 
																	I think people are dressing more confidently and that starts with what they feel comfortable in a pantsuit can be exactly that.
