					<p align="justify">Flowy frocks often come to mind but there are also a variety of silhouettes and embellishments that can make super long dresses more tailored more formal or more of whatever you re looking for. A more casual wedding on the other hand will allow a guest to have a bit more leeway when it comes to choosing her dress. Unless your dress is very formal long gowns work for more casual weddings too. <br>
