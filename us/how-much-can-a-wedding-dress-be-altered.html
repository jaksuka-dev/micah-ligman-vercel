							<h1>How Much Can A Wedding Dress Be Altered</h1>

	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">Before deciding on a wedding dress check on the interior designing of it if there would be any possibilities that it can be altered to the style and size for you. If it can then good it the seamstress cannot do much about it then it would be much better that you find a new dress instead of having to pay for the average price of wedding. If they alter it more then 2 sizes it becomes a whole new dress and very expensive. <br>
